### Documentation
Main Concepts Applied:

* For this project, I used HTML and Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive web page. Tailwind's utility classes like flex, grid, and responsive breakpoints (md:flex-row) made it easy to structure the layout without writing custom CSS.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

* I became more comfortable using Tailwind CSS to build responsive designs quickly. I also learned more about making HTML code accessible and ensuring it’s easy to read and maintain.

### Reflection
What I Learned:
* I learned how to:
    * Use Tailwind CSS for fast and efficient styling.
    * Design a responsive layout that adapts well to both mobile and desktop screens.


### Challenges Faced:
I had an issue where images didn’t load properly due to incorrect src paths and missing alt attributes.

### Solution:
I fixed the image paths and added alt attributes for accessibility. I also adjusted the layout using responsive classes to ensure a good balance between mobile and desktop views.
